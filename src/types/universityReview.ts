/**
 * Mirrors backend `models/ProgramRanking.js`. The original scaffold shape
 * (entries/programId/cycleId, no status field) didn't match what the API
 * actually returns — this rewrite aligns with the backend.
 *
 * The nested `applicant` ref is populated by the backend on GET and on
 * the PUT response (`firstName lastName email`); `submittedBy` is not
 * populated today but is typed permissively so we can do either.
 *
 * `ProgramApplicationSummary` is kept around as an unused but referenced
 * legacy scaffold type — no current caller, but the shape is a reasonable
 * reference for future thin-list endpoints.
